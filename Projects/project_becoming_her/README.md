## Customization üé®

### Adding New Podcasts
To add a new podcast, update the `Podcasters` array in the `data.js` file. Follow this structure:

```javascript
const Podcasters = [
  {
    avatar: "image-url.jpg",
    podcastName: "Podcast Name",
    host: "Host Name",
    reason: "Why I love this podcast",
    benefit: "How it has helped me",
    favoriteEpisode: "Favorite episode title",
  },
  // Add more podcasts here
];

export default Podcasters;
```

### Styling
The app uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling. You can customize the colors, spacing, and other styles by editing the `tailwind.config.js` file or directly modifying the class names in the components.
