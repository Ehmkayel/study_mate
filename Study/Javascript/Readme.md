## Study Logs (JavaScript )

This folder documents my foundational learning and daily practice with **JavaScript**.

I'm focused on strengthening my understanding of the language by exploring key concepts such as:

- DOM manipulation and browser interactions
- Template literals and dynamic string handling
- Conditional logic and comparison operations
- Variables, data types, and arithmetic expressions
- Using the console for debugging and practice outputs

### Week 1

- Studied **data types** in JavaScript (primitive vs reference)
- Learned about **type coercion** and **type conversion**
- Understood how **strict (`===`) vs loose (`==`) equality operators** work
- Reviewed **basic arithmetic and assignment operators** and their behaviors
- Practiced how to dynamically display the current year in the DOM using `Date` and `getElementById`
- Logged personal profile information using template literals and string interpolation
- Used `console.log` as a primary feedback tool for browser based output
- Compared BMI values using arithmetic expressions and conditional statements
- Used `if...else` and logical operators like `||` to compare variables and print results

P.S:. These are not full projects but small, focused exercises designed to build fluency with the language, for projects you can check the projects folder
