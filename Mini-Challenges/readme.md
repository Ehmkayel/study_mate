# Mini Challenges

Welcome to my **Mini Challenges** folder, a collection of small, focused coding exercises designed to help me strengthen my frontend skills and problem-solving abilities.

---

## Purpose

This folder is where I:
- Practice core programming concepts in bite-sized pieces
- Apply what I learn from courses and tutorials
- Build muscle memory for coding through repetition

---

##  Challenge Types

Challenges may include:
- Mini challenges from resources
- Real-life problem simulations 
- Small algorithm or data transformation tasks

---

## Folder Structure

Each challenge will typically have:
- A `.js` or `.ts` file (depending on the language used)
- A brief description or comment inside the file explaining the task
- Output or `console.log()` examples where needed

---

## How I Use This

- To stay consistent with daily or weekly practice
- To revise key topics 
- To document my progress in a way thatâ€™s easy to refer back to

---

## Updates

This folder will grow as I continue to practice. Stay tuned for more mini challenges!
